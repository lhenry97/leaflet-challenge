# leaflet-challenge

This challenge was compeleted as apart of the data anlaytics bootcamp. Earthquake data was obtained from the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
The following json data was used as input for the data (All earthquakes in the last seven days) https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
Leaflet was then used to create a map of the locations of the earthquakes. Different colours were used based on the depth of the earthquake and the circle sizes corresponded to the earthquake sizes.
To create this code, the worked examples in class were used alongside assistance from AI.
